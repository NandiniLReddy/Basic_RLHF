[{"input_text": "I live right next to a huge university, and have been applying for a variety of jobs with them through their faceless electronic jobs portal for a few months. The very first job I applied for, I got an interview that went just so-so. But then, I never heard back (I even looked up the number of the person who called me and called her back, left a voicemail, never heard anything). Now, when I'm applying for subsequent jobs - is it that same HR person who is seeing all my applications?? Or are they forwarded to the specific departments? I've applied for five jobs there in the last four months, all the resumes and cover letters tailored for each open position. Is this hurting my chances? I never got another interview there, for any of the positions.", "context": "Person is asking about job applications through a university portal"}, {"input_text": "I currently live in Texas and I plan on going to university in England, and I think I want to stay there for a while. Before I go to university, though, I wanted to plan a road trip across the US. Obviously this is going to be expensive and I plan on saving money (I already have a lot saved up), but I'm still unsure of the route. I've lived in a couple different places and I've traveled a lot inside the US, but there's still a lot that I haven't seen.

With this visa I need to get married in the USA and I cannot leave USA until I adjust my status, which can takes several months.

It was about 'magicians' in a post apocalyptic world, who searched city ruins for, what is now, modern technology. However they lost most knowledge of the tech in this great catastrophe.

This is the situation: I built a computer 3 years ago. It ran perfectly with occasional hiccups due to viruses and such for two years, but for the past year or so it has been almost unbearable to use according to my family members.
